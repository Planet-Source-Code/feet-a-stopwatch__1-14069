### Description

This Is a StopWatch or timer I made for very new programmers with vb. It has the stopwatch function, pause, pause for certain amount of time and stop and start. It displays 00:00:00 with seconds, minutes, and hours, it will even msgbox you when u get through a whole day on that. By Feet on 1/3/2001 at about 2 A.M. :x. Fully Commented.
 
### More Info
 
to use it u need to put the stop watch sub in a timer with an interval at about 950 seconds(maybe a little less).
